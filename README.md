# VCF2AFAnalysis

created by David Ries

From a vcf file for two pools of a mapping-by-sequencing experiment, create a plot of allele frequencies and identify segregating intervals.
The intervals can be visually determined. Also, an algorithm tries to identify stretches identical to the reference, in botch pools respectively.
